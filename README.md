Machine Learning Algorithms for the prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

This project has been realized for the course of Data Spaces in the Master course of computer engineering at Politecnico di Torino.
The dataset contains 400 rows, 25 features.The aim of this work is to predict if a patient is affected by CKD or not, applying some machine learning algorithms for classification.
In this repository you can find 
* The dataset used ( is also available https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/chronic_kidney_disease )
* The paper that explains, in detail, all of the work done
* The .ipynb notevook that contains all the code and libraries used  for the application of classification algorithms
